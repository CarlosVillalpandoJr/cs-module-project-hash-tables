'''
- With HashTableEntry, want to store not just the value in hash table, but also the key.
    + this would be especially useful when dealing with collisions when there is more than
    one item at each index.
        - each hash table slot, instead of holding single value, will hold a linked list
        (1 LL for each hash table slot) and if there is a collision you add it onto LL
        that is already there.
    + instead of just storing value, store the whole HashTableEntry in our data.
